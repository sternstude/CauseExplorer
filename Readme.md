### Introduction

Work for The Thirty-Eighth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).

**CauseExplorer (CE)** is a new framework for **LLMs abductive reasoning**, which determines the authenticity of possible cause by transforming thinking from reverse to forward and removing irrelevant information.

**CauseLogics** is an abductive logical reasoning decision dataset, which contains tasks of varying reasoning lengths.

More research details and specific code implementation will be made public after our work is accepted

### Version

- 2024-5-22: Dataset and experimental results is available now. Code will be released after the acceptance of our paper.
