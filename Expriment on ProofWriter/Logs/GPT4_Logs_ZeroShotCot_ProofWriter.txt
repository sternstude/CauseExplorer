"{\"Judgement\": \"False\", \"Reason\": \"The assertion that Harry is green based on him being cold is not supported because there is no given premise directly stating that Harry is cold.

"{\"Judgement\":\"True\",\"Reason\":\"Given that Harry is blue and based on the premises that young, blue things are rough, it can be inferred that Harry is rough.
