"{\"Judgement\":true,\"Reason\":According to the premises provided, Gary being honest and nervous would make him brave, and being positive would make him friendly. Therefore, it is possible that Gary is friendly because he is nervous.\"}"
"{\"Judgement\":False,\"Reason\":The possible reason of Jane being nervous would not likely cause the result of Jane being positive as there is no direct relationship between being nervous and being positive according to the premises.
